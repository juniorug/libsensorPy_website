                Children and adults with sickle cell disease may be at risk for problems with learning, memory and planning. For children, academic achievement should be closely monitored to ensure that any special learning needs are met.<br/><br/>                 
                Children with sickle cell disease from elementary through high school are eligible, at minimum, for such special accommodations as having increased access to water and to the bathroom. Check with your social worker or school about a 504 plan. Some children may need an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).  Again, check with your social worker or school about the steps that you need to take to find out if your child needs an IEP, and how to get one. Finally, college aged students are often eligible for services through Special Students or Exceptional Students departments. Talk with your social worker about how to find and apply for these services.<br/><br/>                
                Employers should not discriminate against people with sickle cell disease. Individuals with sickle cell disease are eligible for reasonable accommodations so that they can be productive members of the workplace. Check with your social worker for assistance with educating employers about sickle cell disease.<br/><br/>

                <h2>Transitioning from a pediatric sickle cell center to adult centered care</h2>
                <p>
                Transitions are a way of life. You transition from childhood to adolescence, and through different grades in school. As children transition into young adulthood, it is important that they have future plans that include chances to develop skills, gain knowledge and identify resources for success. Just as they plan for college or employment or living independently, they should also plan for medical care in the adult world.<br/><br/>                
                A successful transition involves a team effort-between patient, family and provider-to ensure uninterrupted, coordinated and comprehensive care through all stages of life. Care should be appropriate for each stage of life, from physical, social and emotional standpoints

                <h2>Medical Home Model</h2>                
                <p>A medical home is not a place, but is an approach to providing health care where patients and their families and health care providers work together so that that the medical and non-medical needs of the patient are met.</p>
                <br/>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
                	<p>With the medical home:</p>
                    <li>"Everybody knows your name"</li>
                    <li>Health care providers have the mindset of family</li>
                    <li>Patients and families feel respected</li>
                    <li>There is a sense of trust and openness</li>
                    <li>Patients thrive in their communities - they are able to access a range of services</li>
                    <li>Patients, families and health care providers are partners on the journey </li> 
                    <li>Life-long health and well-being is the goal,  from childhood to adulthood.</li> 
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>
                The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed the medical home model in 1967. In 2007 the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) teamed with the AAP and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), to create the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), for patients of all ages.<br/><br/>                 
                The Joint Principles support the bond between patient and provider. Under the principles, each provider is part of a team that is responsible for the care of each patient. Patients are also guided through the complex health care system and receive care from a range of special health services.  The overall focus of the Patient-Centered Medical Home has been making health care accessible to patients of all ages.<br/><br/>
