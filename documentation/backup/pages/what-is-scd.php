                        DID YOU KNOW?<br/><br/>  

                        In 1990, the California Newborn Screening Program started testing ALL babies born in the state for sickle cell disease.<br/><br/> 
                        This testing allowed children with sickle cell disease to get life saving therapies by the time they were two months old.<br/><br/>
                        Another important outcome from this was that babies who tested positive for sickle cell trait were identified.<br/><br/>
                        The state offers over-the-phone counseling for Newborn Screening results. Face-to-face counseling and testing for both parents is also available in many areas.<br/><br/>
                        Since  2006, all states test ALL babies born for sickle cell.<br/><br/>
                        Sickle cell is just one of the over 200 different hemoglobin types.

                <h2>What is Sickle Cell Disease?</h2>
                
                <p>Sickle cell disease refers to a group of genetic disorders of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carry oxygen. The conditions cause a change in hemoglobin A that create hemoglobin S. "Sickle cell anemia" refers to the condition where both hemoglobins are S (hemoglobin SS). Sickle cell disease refers to hemoglobin S in combination with another type of hemoglobin, such as C, D or E. The most common sickle combinations are: hemoglobins SS, SC, and S beta zero or S beta plus thalassemia.  Hemoglobin S occurring with hemoglobin A as the dominant hemoglobin (AS) is sickle cell trait and is not a disease.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The sickle gene affects the red blood cells</li><br/>
                    <li>Sickle cell trait IS NOT sickle cell disease, and will NOT turn into sickle cell disease</li><br/>
                    <li>A person with sickle cell trait inherited one gene for regular hemoglobin (A) from one parent and one gene for sickle hemoglobin (S) from the other</li><br/> 
                    <li>A person with sickle cell disease inherited a gene FROM EACH PARENT that caused the disease</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Remember: If you don't know your trait status,<br/> 
                "It's Best to Get the Test!"</h2>
                <div class="vertical_rule_425"></div>
                
                <h2>Common symptoms associated with sickle cell disease include:</h2>
                <p>Pain; acute chest syndrome; pulmonary hypertension; increased susceptibility to infection; protein in the urine; priapism; gall stones; bone disease; skin ulcers; severe anemia; problems with the spleen (splenic sequestration); brain injury; and problems with the eyes (retinopathy).<br/><br/>
                The prevalence of hemoglobin S is high in the African American population, 1:14; the prevalence of sickle cell disease of all kinds is about 1:350 African Americans.  The prevalence of hemoglobin S in the Hispanic population is less, about 1:1000; the prevalence of the disease in this population is not known.<br/><br/>  
The sickle mutation occurs in peoples from the Mediterranean, India, and other regions.  Sickle cell trait occurs in Caucasians as well; in this group symptoms can be more severe than in other groups.  It is believed that there are 100,000 people with sickle cell disease in the United States.</p>

<h2>Sickle Cell Trait</h2>
                <p>Sickle cell trait is when a person has one normal ("Usual") hemoglobin ("Hee-moh-glow-bin") gene and one sickle cell gene that is passed down from their biological parents.</p>

<h2>Inheritance Patterns</h2>
				<ul>
                    <li>Sickle cell disease is not contagious</li>
                    <li>It is passed down in a recessive pattern from biological parents</li> 
                    <li>If two parents have trait, they may have a child with sickle cell disease</li>                    
                    <li>One parent with disease and one parent with trait may also have a child with disease</li>

                <p>Example of two parents with the same hemoglobin trait (AS- known as sickle cell trait): for EACH PREGNANCY, this child could have usual hemoglobin ( "AA" shown in navy blue), sickle cell trait ("AS" shown in aqua) or sickle cell disease ("SS" shown in yellow)

                Example of one parent with sickle cell trait ("AS") and one parent with sickle cell disease ("SS"): for EACH PREGNANCY this child could have either sickle cell trait ("AS") or sickle cell disease ("SS")

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <p><em>How can I find out if I or my child has been tested?</em><br/>
                   If you were born in California after 1990, you have been tested.  You may want to contact your pediatrician, birth hospital, or doctor's office to get the result.  If you have children, your doctor may have tested you when you were expecting.</p>
				<br/>
               	<p><em>What kinds of sickle cell tests are there?</em><br/>
                  The two most common are "Hemoglobin electrophoresis with a CBC" and the solubility, or "SickleDexTM"  The hemoglobin electrophoresis with the CBC is a more complete test, as it tests for most of the hemoglobin types (there are over 200).  The solubility test does test for hemoglobin S, or sickle, but does not test for the other hemoglobin types.  If a person has another type of hemoglobin trait, this test type will not show it.</p>  
				<br/><br/>
<p><em>What if I had a solubility test?</em><br/>
                    This means you have been tested for sickle cell disease and trait, but if you happen to be a carrier of another type of hemoglobin it will not show from this test.</p>
				<br/>
               	<p><em>How can I find out my hemoglobin type?</em></p>
               	<ul>
                    <li>If you were born in CA after 1990, contact your birth hospital, pediatrician or doctor's office. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) will also have this information.</li>  
                    <li>If you were born in another state, contact your doctor or that state's Department of Public Health, as it changes from state to state when they started testing all babies for sickle cell disease and trait.</li>  
	 		   	</ul>
                <br/>
			   	<p><em>What if I have sickle cell trait?</em></p>
               	<ul>
                    <li>You can live a long, normal, healthy life.  Most people who have trait might not even know they have it.</li>  
                    <li>You might pass it on to your child.</li> 
                    <li>If you and your partner both have sickle cell or other hemoglobin traits, it is recommended that you contact a sickle cell counselor, genetic counselor or a CCS  approved Sickle Cell Disease Special Care Center for more information as you are at risk for having a child with sickle cell disease.</li>
